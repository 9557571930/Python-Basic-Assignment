        "   - Python is a programming language that is easy to understand and write, making it a popular choice among developers and programmers.\n",
        "It is compatible with various programming paradigms, such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",
        "Python has a large and active community of developers, an extensive standard library, and third-party packages for various domains.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2.What is an interpreter in Python?**\n",
        "  - In Python, an **interpreter** is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line. It takes the source code written by the programmer and directly executes it, without needing to compile it into machine-level code first.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Lexical Analysis**: The interpreter reads the Python code and converts it into a set of tokens.\n",
        "2. **Parsing**: It analyzes the syntax of the code and generates an intermediate representation, often referred to as the \"abstract syntax tree\" (AST).\n",
        "3. **Execution**: The interpreter executes the code by converting the AST into machine instructions (or bytecode) and runs it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is often considered an interpreted language because it is executed in this way, although technically, it is compiled to bytecode (a lower-level, platform-independent representation) before being interpreted by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).\n",
        "\n",
        "In simpler terms, when you run a Python program, the Python interpreter directly executes your code, which allows for an interactive and flexible development process.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?**\n",
        "  - Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.).\n",
        "Examples of keywords include if, else, while, for, def, class, import, try, except, return, True, False, None, etc.\n",
        "Keywords are case-sensitive and cannot be redefined or overridden within a Python program.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4.Can keywords be used as variable names?**\n",
        "  - No, **keywords** in Python cannot be used as variable names. Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meanings and purposes in the language. They are part of the Python syntax and are predefined by the language itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, words like `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `class`, `def`, `True`, `False`, and `None` are keywords. These are used to define control structures, data types, and other core components of Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you try to use a keyword as a variable name, Python will raise a **SyntaxError**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5.What is mutability in Python?**\n",
        "   - **Mutability** in Python refers to whether or not the state (or value) of an object can be changed after it is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Mutable objects**: These are objects whose values can be changed or modified after they are created. In other words, you can alter the content of the object without creating a new object.\n",

        "  - The difference between lists being mutable and tuples being immutable in Python is rooted in their design and intended use cases. Here's a breakdown:\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Purpose and Use Case**\n",
        "- **Lists**: Designed to be **dynamic** collections of items. They are used when you need a collection of elements that might change during the program’s lifecycle. For example, adding, removing, or modifying elements in a list is common.\n",
        "- **Tuples**: Designed to be **static** collections of items. They are used when the data should not change after being defined, providing a way to group related pieces of information together (e.g., coordinates or configuration settings).\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Memory Optimization**\n",
        "- **Lists**: Since they are mutable, Python has to allocate additional memory to allow for dynamic resizing and modification.\n",
        "- **Tuples**: Being immutable, they can use less memory and allow certain optimizations. They are hashable if all their elements are hashable, making them usable as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Thread Safety**\n",
        "- **Lists**: Their mutability can lead to unintended side effects when shared across threads.\n",
        "- **Tuples**: Immutable data structures, like tuples, are inherently thread-safe since their contents cannot be changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. Implementation Detail**\n",
        "- **Lists**: Maintain dynamic data structures with methods like `.append()`, `.remove()`, and slicing operations that allow modification.\n",
        "- **Tuples**: Do not support any methods that modify their contents. Once created, the object’s state remains constant, which simplifies their internal representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **5. Logical Consistency**\n",
        "- Lists represent collections that may grow, shrink, or change. Mutability aligns with this dynamic nature.\n",
        "- Tuples represent fixed, unchanging sets of values. Immutability aligns with their static nature.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",

        "- **Pros**:\n",

        "   - It starts with the `if` condition.\n",
        "   - If the `if` condition evaluates to `True`, the associated block is executed, and the rest of the `elif` and `else` blocks are skipped.\n",
        "   - If the `if` condition is `False`, it moves to the first `elif` condition, and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **First True Condition Wins**:\n",
        "   - Only the block corresponding to the **first condition that evaluates to `True`** is executed.\n",
        "   - After executing that block, the program exits the entire `if-elif-else` structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **`else` Block (Optional)**:\n",
        "   - If none of the `if` or `elif` conditions evaluate to `True`, the `else` block (if present) is executed as a fallback.\n",

        "**Explanation**:\n",
        "1. The `if` condition (`number < 10`) is checked first and evaluates to `False`.\n",
        "2. The first `elif` condition (`number < 20`) evaluates to `True`, so the corresponding block is executed.\n",

        "### **Key Points**\n",
        "1. **Order Matters**:\n",
        "   - The `if-elif-else` structure is evaluated sequentially, so conditions should be ordered logically.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     if x < 20:\n",
        "         print(\"x is less than 20\")\n",

        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **One Block Executed**:\n",
        "   - At most, **one block** of code is executed in an `if-elif-else` structure, even if multiple conditions are `True`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **`elif` Is Optional**:\n",
        "   - You can use `if` and `else` without any `elif`:\n",

        "- When you have multiple **mutually exclusive conditions** to check.\n",
        "- To avoid nested `if` statements, which can make the code harder to read. For example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  # Nested ifs (harder to read)\n",
